## Infrastructure Monitoring

Infrastructure monitoring tools are designed to monitor the health and performance of servers, networks, and other critical components of an IT infrastructure. These tools help in identifying issues, analyzing resource utilization, and ensuring the overall stability and reliability of the infrastructure.

### Tools

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It provides time-series data collection, querying, and alerting capabilities, making it a popular choice for monitoring distributed systems.

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/): A leading open-source analytics and monitoring platform. Grafana allows users to visualize and analyze data from various sources, including Prometheus, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, and more.

### Resources

- [Prometheus Documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/): The official documentation for Prometheus, providing in-depth guides on how to set up, configure, and use Prometheus for monitoring.

- [Grafana Tutorials](https://grafana.com/tutorials/): A collection of tutorials and guides for using Grafana effectively, covering various aspects of data visualization and analysis.

## Application Monitoring

Application monitoring tools focus on tracking the performance and health of applications and services. They help identify bottlenecks, errors, and potential improvements to ensure the smooth functioning of applications.

### Tools

- [Datadog](https://www.datadog.com/): A cloud monitoring platform that offers full-stack observability. Datadog provides comprehensive monitoring, metrics, traces, and logs for infrastructure, applications, and services.

- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/): A monitoring and observability platform that provides real-time insights into the performance and health of applications, servers, and infrastructure.

### Resources

- [New Relic University](https://learn.newrelic.com/): An online learning platform with courses, tutorials, and documentation on using New Relic for application monitoring and performance management.

## Log Management

Log management tools centralize, analyze, and visualize logs generated by various applications and services. These tools help in monitoring system activities, troubleshooting issues, and maintaining compliance.

### Tools

- [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack): A combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana used for centralized log management and analysis. Elasticsearch stores and indexes logs, Logstash processes and ships logs, and Kibana provides a web interface for visualization and analysis.

- [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/): A powerful log management and analysis platform that helps organizations gain insights from their machine data.

### Resources

- [ELK Stack Getting Started Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html): A step-by-step guide to getting started with the ELK Stack for log management.

- [Splunk Documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/): The official documentation for Splunk, providing comprehensive guides and reference materials.

## Network Monitoring

Network monitoring tools focus on monitoring network devices, traffic, and performance to identify and resolve network-related issues. These tools help in maintaining network health and optimizing performance.

### Tools

- [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/): A widely-used open-source monitoring system that offers comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities for servers, network devices, and applications.
